<!-- footer is huge, very unnessisary -->
<!-- home and about sections have to be clear about what this site is trying to do -->
<!-- add wow animation? data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="0" looks to be the same basic thing as wow on about me section-->
<!-- use sections for links to bball/baseball reference and other useful sites education is important and links to resources-->
