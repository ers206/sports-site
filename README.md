## Description
 The site utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a sleek and responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices. Custom typography from Google Fonts gives the site a modern and clean look, while Bootstrap Icons and Flaticon enhance the visual appeal with intuitive icons. Interactive features are powered by Tiny Slider for smooth carousels and image galleries, and AOS (Animate On Scroll) adds dynamic animations that bring the content to life as users scroll. Glightbox is used to create stylish overlays for viewing images and videos, and PHP for form control.

<!-- Minimize and Compress Files:

Minify your CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files. Tools like UglifyJS (for JavaScript) and CSSNano (for CSS) can help reduce file size by removing unnecessary spaces, comments, and code.
Use Gzip or Brotli compression on your server to reduce the size of text-based resources before they're sent to the browser.
Lazy Load Images:

Implement lazy loading for images, so they only load as users scroll down the page. This reduces initial load time.
Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):

A CDN stores your website's content on servers around the world, reducing latency by serving content from a server close to the user.
Optimize Web Fonts:

Limit the number of web fonts used and ensure they are optimized. Use modern font formats like WOFF2 and preload key fonts for faster delivery.
Leverage Browser Caching:

Set appropriate cache expiration for static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript, so users don’t have to re-download them on subsequent visits.
Enable HTTP/2:

HTTP/2 allows browsers to load multiple files in parallel over a single connection, speeding up page load times.
Reduce Redirects:

Minimize or eliminate unnecessary redirects to avoid additional HTTP requests.
Database Optimization:

If you're using a CMS or database-driven site, optimize your database by cleaning up old data, revising queries, and setting up caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached. -->


<!-- Ensure Your Hosting Plan Supports PHP:

GoDaddy offers different hosting plans, such as shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting. Make sure your hosting plan supports PHP. Most GoDaddy plans come with PHP support, but double-check if you’re on a basic shared hosting plan.
PHP Version Compatibility:

GoDaddy allows you to select different PHP versions. Ensure the version you're using locally (like PHP 8.x) is supported on your GoDaddy server. You can change the PHP version in the hosting control panel if needed.
File and Folder Permissions:

Set proper file and folder permissions. Typically, PHP files should have permissions set to 644, and directories should be set to 755 to ensure they are secure but accessible to the server.
PHP Mail Settings:

If you’re using PHP mail functions (e.g., PHPMailer), make sure to configure the email settings correctly with GoDaddy’s SMTP server. GoDaddy might have specific requirements for outgoing mail to prevent spam filtering.
Database Configuration:

If your PHP forms interact with a database, ensure the database credentials (host, username, password) are properly configured for GoDaddy's MySQL or other databases.
.htaccess Configuration:

If you need URL rewriting or specific configurations, ensure your .htaccess file is set up correctly. Some servers require particular directives for PHP or URL rewrites to work properly.
SSL Setup:

Ensure that SSL is correctly configured for secure form submissions (especially if sensitive data is being handled). GoDaddy offers SSL certificates, which you can install through your hosting account.
GoDaddy Deployment Workflow:

Use GoDaddy’s file manager or FTP to upload your PHP files. If you’re using version control like Git, some plans allow you to deploy directly via Git. Make sure all your PHP scripts and related assets are uploaded to the correct directories. -->
